* Solar influence
* Bulk
* Movement specifications

* Each neuron of the penultimate layer is connected with every neuron of the last layer

## 7.3 Evaluation function
Function that defines the operation in each neuron
With inputs as X0 to XN
With Bias as Y
With result as Z  
Z = SIN(SUM(Xn*Y)) FOR n in range 0,N

* Quality = Bulk + Energy * 3 + NumProle * 2

With Q as the result of quality function  
With A as start state  
With Bi as representation of the bias  

* The learning process is based on try and error  
* The base of the learning process is the matrix of Bias
* Before an activity the entity generates a new matrix of Bias mutating from the previous one
* After the activity the entity evaluates the quality result
  * If the quality result is equal or better than the previous the entity maintains the mutation of the Bias
  * If the quality result is worse than the previous, the entity discard the mutation of the Bias

Example explication :   
Starting from state A with a quality evaluation with value 4.  
The entity generate a Bias with Id equal to 0.  
The entity goes to state B with a quality evaluation with value 5 and a Id of Bias equal to 1 so it maintains the Bias that orders the activity.  
The entity generate a Bias with Id equal to 1.  
The entity goes to state C with a quality evaluation with value 4 and a Id of Bias equal to 2 so it maintains the Bias that orders the activity.  
The entity discard the Bias 1 because it generates a less efficient result, so the entity returns to the Bias 0.  
The entity generates a new Bias based en Bias 0.  
In case of not discarding the bias, the entity generates the Bias based on Bias 1.  

A -> Q = 4 Bi = 0  
|  
B -> Q = 5 Bi = 1   
|  
C -> Q = 4 Bi = (regression to Bi = 0)
